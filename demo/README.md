# Storybook application for the Aries Mobile Components

This application is created for the purpose of testing the components. When
creating a new component, a story has to be added so we can test the props and
how they interact with the component.

## getting started

1. Install the dependencies

```console
yarn
```

2. Launch the application

```console
yarn start
```

3. Listen for storybook changes

```console
yarn storybook-watcher
```
